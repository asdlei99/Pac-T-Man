# Pac-T-Man
Project to implement my own *Pac-Man* game using *DirectX 11*. As an inpiration, the original version from 1980 was used.

There is dependency to *DirectXTK* which could be easily avoided but it is trivial to satisify it thru Nuget package thus I decided to keep it.

# Controls
- `Left/Right/Up/Down arrow` - movement.

The feeling from the game should be similar as you would have from playing the 1980's version.

# Features
- You can move around.
- You can be eaten by the ghosts.
- You can eat energizer (the big dot) and hunt the ghosts.
- The game follows different stages (ghosts can be chasing PacMan or running away).
- Each ghosts has its unique AI based on the 1980's version. Only one difference here - there is known and documented bug in Pinky behavior - TODO - I did not implmenet this to my version :)
